## Steps
**
1.Get the `prealloc.yml.zip` file from CR.
    * Unzip prealloc.yml.zip

2.Get the `hmc_enc.yml.zip` file from CR.
    * Unzip hmc_enc.yml.zip

3. a) Login to the VPC deployment server and clone hs-pre-alloc repo(see Howhttps://github.ibm.com/ZaaS/iaas-docs/blob/5ab0f94693ac40a1d11fff1a6538cfc804760513/gen_vpc/runbooks/deployer-howto.md)
    b) Create subdirectory 'ha_images' in the home directory of the user's deployer (e.g :- /home/gakumar/ha_images)
    c) clone the hs-pre-alloc repo in the same. use :- git clone git@github.ibm.com:ZaaS/hs-pre-alloc.git
NOTE****  
 (Please do ssh set up to perform git clone in the local deployer)
     e.g :- gakumar@dal2-qz2-sr2-rk219-s04:~/ha_images$ git clone git@github.ibm.com:ZaaS/hs-pre-alloc.git

 The exe's can be found in bin directory.

 gakumar@dal2-qz2-sr2-rk219-s04:~/ha_images/hs-pre-alloc/bin$ ls -l
 total 20348
 -rwxr-x--- 1 gakumar uaemployees 10295818 Dec 14 09:02 hs-pre-alloc-linux-amd64
 -rwxr-x--- 1 gakumar uaemployees 10601329 Dec 14 09:02 hs-pre-alloc-linux-s390x
NOTE***


4. Copy files to fowarder node
  >fn=wdc3-qz1-sr2-rk086-s01
  >gt -Z mzone777 -U sysop
  >gt $fn --put prealloc.yml /home/sysop
  >gt $fn --put hmc_enc.yml /home/sysop
  >gt $fn --put hs-pre-alloc-linux-s390x /home/sysop

5. Login to forwarder and change to root
  >gt $fn
  >sudo bash

6. Create `~/ha_images/` directory on forwarder node in /home/sysop directory and Copy the downloaded `hs-pre-alloc-linux-s390x` executable to `~/ha_images/` directory

7. Copy the downloaded ` prealloc.yml.` executable to `~/ha_images/` directory

8 Copy the downloaded ` hmc_enc.yml.` executable to `~/ha_images/` directory

This step creates hipersocket adapters on the HMC and pre-allocates them for use by baremetal partitions

9.  cd ha_images
10.  # ./hs-pre-alloc-linux-s390x create --hmc hmc_enc.yml -c prealloc.yml
11. If previous step fails HPS IaaS will do a manual cleanup and then ask IPOPs to re-run that step. 

##Manual Clean-up ran by HPS IaaS
1. Log into Remote desktop for wdc
2. Log in HMC for 
3.Go to Partitions Details for  wdc3-qz1-sr2-rk086-s01
4. Select Network, Select appropriate NIC (e.g. s26_hs_0)
5.Select Actions; Select delete
6 Click Apply; Click ok
7. Re-run step 8 of above Steps
